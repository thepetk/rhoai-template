The templates in this directory are created via an automated script that takes the sample applications and adds the backstage content into template form.

This process enables single changes to the master template and regeneration of all the samples with that template.

Do not edit these templates manually.  

To experiment with manual changes, copy a template from this directory into `../experimental`.  Add a reference to the template in `../all.yaml`. In future this file may be autogenerated from the list in `./templates` and `./experimental` to simplify creation.
